# Example INIT.ORA file

# To set up a database that multiple instances will be using, place
# all instance-specific parameters in one file, and then have all
# of these files point to a master file using the IFILE command.
# This way, when you change a public
# parameter, it will automatically change on all instances. This is
# necessary, since all instances must run with the same value for many
# parameters. For example, if you choose to use private rollback segments,
# these must be specified in different files, but since all gc_*
# parameters must be the same on all instances, they should be in one file.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS: Edit this file and the other INIT files it calls for
# your site, either by using the values provided here or by providing
# your own. Then place an IFILE= line into each instance-specific
# INIT file that points at this file.
#
# NOTE: Parameter values suggested in this file are based on conservative
# estimates for computer memory availability. You should adjust values upward
# for modern machines.
